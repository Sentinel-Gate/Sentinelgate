# Sentinel Gate Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Version 1.0 — January 2026**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sentinel Gate ("Project"), owned and maintained by **Andrea Pinizzotto and the Sentinel Gate team** ("Maintainer"), operating as the Sentinel Gate project.

To clarify the intellectual property rights in the Project, and to grant licenses to the Maintainer, you must accept this Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") before your contribution can be accepted.

## 1. Definitions

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing work, that you intentionally submit to the Maintainer for inclusion in the Project.

**"Submit"** means any form of communication sent to the Maintainer, including but not limited to pull requests, issues, commits, emails, or messages on project communication channels.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to the Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works
- Sublicense all or part of the foregoing rights to third parties
- **Relicense the Contributions under any license**, including proprietary licenses
- **Assign this Agreement and all rights to a successor entity** (e.g., Sentinel Gate Ltd when incorporated)

This grant includes the right for the Maintainer (or successor entity) to offer the Project and your Contributions under dual-license terms (e.g., AGPL-3.0 for open source distribution and a separate commercial license for customers who prefer not to comply with AGPL-3.0 obligations).

## 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to the Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your Contribution with the Project.

## 4. Representations

You represent that:

a) **You have the legal authority** to enter into this Agreement.

b) **You own the copyright** to your Contributions, or you have received permission from the copyright owner to submit the Contributions under the terms of this Agreement.

c) **Your Contributions are your original work** and do not violate any third party's intellectual property or other rights.

d) **Your Contributions do not contain** any malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities intentionally introduced.

e) If you are employed or your Contributions are made in the course of your employment, **you have obtained permission** from your employer to submit the Contributions under this Agreement, or your employer has waived such rights.

## 5. Assignment to Successor Entity

You acknowledge and agree that the Maintainer may assign this Agreement and all rights granted hereunder to a successor entity (such as Sentinel Gate Ltd upon incorporation) without requiring additional consent from you.

## 6. No Obligation

You understand that:

- The Maintainer is not obligated to use or include your Contributions in the Project
- The decision to use or include Contributions is at the sole discretion of the Maintainer
- The Maintainer may modify, reject, or remove Contributions at any time

## 7. No Support Obligation

You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, except to the extent you desire to provide support. Support, if any, is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind.

## 8. Disclaimer

YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
