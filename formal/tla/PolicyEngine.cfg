\* TLC configuration for PolicyEngine model checking
\* Run with: java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC MC_PolicyEngine -config PolicyEngine.cfg

\* Use MCSpec which explicitly enumerates requests in fairness (TLC limitation)
SPECIFICATION MCSpec

\* Map abstract constants to concrete MC definitions
\* Use <- to evaluate the operator rather than substituting a model value
CONSTANT Requests <- MCRequests
CONSTANT Rules <- MCRules
CONSTANT RulePriority <- MCRulePriority
CONSTANT RuleAction <- MCRuleAction
CONSTANT RuleMatches <- MCRuleMatches
CONSTANT PolicySets <- MCPolicySets
CONSTANT PolicySetRules <- MCPolicySetRules
CONSTANT InitialPolicySet <- MCInitialPolicySet

\* Safety invariants (checked in every reachable state)
INVARIANT TypeOK
INVARIANT SafetyInvariant
INVARIANT NoMixedPolicyInvariant

\* Temporal properties (uses MCLivenessProperty with explicit enumeration)
PROPERTY MCLivenessProperty
